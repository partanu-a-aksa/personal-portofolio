**Situation**:  
XYZ Retail, an established retail company, sought to expand into e-commerce to reach a wider audience and streamline its sales processes. They needed a scalable, user-friendly platform to support both desktop and mobile users with features like product browsing, user reviews, secure checkout, and real-time inventory updates.

**Task**:  
I was responsible for building the front-end and back-end components of the platform, ensuring seamless integration with the client’s inventory and payment systems. The project goal was to create an efficient, high-performing application with a smooth user experience.

**Action**:  
Using **React** for the front-end, I designed a responsive, intuitive UI focused on user engagement and easy navigation. On the back end, I developed RESTful APIs with **Node.js** and **MongoDB** for data management. Additionally, I integrated the platform with **AWS** to optimize loading times and set up a CI/CD pipeline for faster deployment and testing. I worked closely with designers and QA to address usability and accessibility standards.

**Result**:  
The project was completed on time, leading to a 35% increase in online sales within the first three months. User feedback highlighted the site's speed and ease of use, and the client reported a substantial reduction in manual inventory management tasks.
